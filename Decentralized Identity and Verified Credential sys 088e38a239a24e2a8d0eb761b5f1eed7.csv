Marinade,"Marinade is the first non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Solana. Stake your SOL tokens with Marinade and receive mSOL (“marinated SOL”) tokens in return that can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi). mSOL is the most widely integrated collateralized version of SOL. The price of mSOL goes up relative to SOL each epoch, with rewards being accrued into your stake account.

An Efficient System for Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials with Optional Anonymity Revocation,"A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing all-or-nothing
 sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.","@Albert Garreta please provide an abstract

Decentralized Anonymous Credentials,"Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation of today’s anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted credential issuer — which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility. In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash that, given a public append-only ledger, do not need a trusted credential issuer. Furthermore, given a distributed public ledger, as in, e.g., Bitcoin, our system requires no credential issuer at all and hence is decentralized. Using such a public ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees without relying on trusted parties. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks. We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency.",,No,Yes,,Basireddy Swaroopa Reddy,,"Anonymous Credentials, VC",2014,"Cryptographic primitive (Anonymous Credential), decentralized issuer",https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clg/files/NDSS14.pdf,,Yes,"October 10, 2022",Jorge Arce-Garro,Very relevant,Academic literature
DECO,"Thanks to the widespread deployment of TLS, users can access private data over channels with end-to-end confidentiality and integrity. What they cannot do, however, is prove to third parties the provenance of such data, i.e., that it genuinely came from a particular website. Existing approaches either introduce undesirable trust assumptions or require server-side modifications. As a result, the value of users' private data is locked up in its point of origin. Users cannot export their data with preserved integrity to other applications without help and permission from the current data holder. We propose DECO (short for decentralized oracle to address the above problems. DECO allows users to prove that a piece of data accessed via TLS came from a particular website and optionally prove statements about such data in zero-knowledge, keeping the data itself secret. DECO is the first such system that works without trusted hardware or server-side modifications. DECO can liberate data from centralized web-service silos, making it accessible to a rich spectrum of applications. To demonstrate the power of DECO, we implement three applications that are hard to achieve without it: a private financial instrument using smart contracts, converting legacy credentials to anonymous credentials, and verifiable claims against price discrimination.",Describe in “One getting data to Web3” part,Yes,Yes,,"Ignacio, Ahmet Ramazan Agirtas",,"DI, Data to Web3",2019,"Implementations, Legacy compatible, Management of credentials, Possible tool in larger solution, Worthwile Sybil resistance insights",https://www.deco.works/,,No,"November 1, 2022",Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka,Very relevant,Hybrid
CanDiD,"We present CanDID, a platform for practical, userfriendly realization of decentralized identity, the idea of empowering end users with management of their own credentials. While decentralized identity promises to give users greater
control over their private data, it burdens users with management of private keys, creating a significant risk of key loss. Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy. CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials
in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user’s keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users.

Blockchain-Based Verifiable Credential Sharing with Selective Disclosure,"Sharing credentials could raise privacy concerns. For digital credentials to be widely accepted, there is a need for an end-to-end system that provides (i) secure verification of the participant identities and credentials to increase trust, and (ii) a data minimisation mechanism to reduce the risk of oversharing the credential data. This paper proposes CredChain, a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) platform architecture that allows secure creation, sharing and verification of credentials. Beyond the verification of identities and credentials, a flexible selective disclosure solution is proposed using redactable signatures. The credentials are managed through a decentralised application/wallet which allows users to store their credential data privately under their full control and re-use as necessary.

We prove security of our scheme under the LRSW assumption for groups with bilinear maps. We then show how our scheme can be used to construct efficient anonymous credential systems as well as group signature and identity escrow schemes.

Despite the decentralized and trustless architectures of the blockchain systems, smart contracts on their own cannot access data from the external world.

However, there is always risk of oracles providing corrupt, malicious, or inaccurate data. In this paper, we analyze and present the notion of trust in the oracles used in blockchain ecosystems.

Our system is truly decentralized. Using an append-only distributed ledger such as Bitcoin's blockchain, we show how participants can make anonymous yet verifiable assertions about their own reputation. In particular, reputation can be demonstrated and updated effectively using efficient zkSNARK proofs. The system maintains soundness, peer-pseudonym unlinkability as well as unlinkability among pseudonyms of the same peer.

DID and VC:Untangling Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials for the Web of Trust,"Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials have been proposed as a self-sovereign and privacy-friendly alternative to centralized and proprietary authentication services. Currently, a W3C standard exists that attempts to unify existing proposals and to find a common layer for decentralized identification and verification. However, there are some limitations of decentralized identifiers in comparison to established, centrally controlled authentication platforms concerning trust, privacy and usability. In this paper, we first describe all workflows which are necessary to create, share and verify a verifiable credential and second, we discuss the limitations concerning trust, privacy and usability of decentralized identifiers. The paper summarizes the involved workflows for decentralized authentication as proposed by the current standard.

Towards a standardized model for privacy-preserving Verifiable Credentials,"Lack of standardization and the subsequent difficulty of integration has been one of the main reasons for the scarce adoption of privacy-preserving Attribute-Based Credentials (p-ABC). Integration with the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials (VC) specification would help by encouraging homogenization between different p-ABC schemes and bringing them all closer to other digital credentials. What is more, p-ABCs can help to solve privacy issues that have been identified in applications of VCs to use cases like vaccination passports. However, there has not been much work focusing on the collaboration between p-ABCs and VCs. We address this topic by establishing initial steps for extra standardization of elements that will help with the integration of p-ABCs into the standard. Namely, we propose a data model for predicates, which are a staple of p-ABC systems, and tools and guidelines to ease the adaptation process like a validation meta-schema. These ideas have been applied in a proof-of-concept implementation of the OLYMPUS distributed p-ABC scheme paired with serialization following the VC data model.",@Jorge Arce-Garro any opinion on this piece?,No,Yes,,Jorge Arce-Garro,,VC,2021,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465481.3469204,,No,"November 22, 2022",Michal Zajac,Relevant,
A Verifiable Credentials System with Privacy-Preserving Based on Blockchain,"Decentralized identity authentication is generally based on blockchain, with the protection of user privacy as the core appeal. But traditional decentralized credential system requires users to show all the information of the entire credential to the verifier, resulting in unnecessary overexposure of personal information. From the perspective of user privacy, this paper proposed a verifiable credential scheme with selective disclosure based on BLS (Bohen- Lynn-Shacham) aggregate signature. Instead of signing the credentials, we sign the claims in the credentials. When the user needs to present the credential to verifier, the user can select a part of but not all claims to be presented. To reduce the number of signatures of claims after selective disclosure, BLS aggregate signature is achieved to aggregate signatures of claims into one signature. In addition, our scheme also supports the aggregation of credentials from different users. As a result, verifier only needs to verify one signature in the credential to achieve the purpose of batch verification of credentials. We analyze the security of our aggregate signature scheme, which can effectively resist aggregate signature forgery attack and credential theft attack. The simulation results show that our selective disclosure scheme based on BLS aggregate signature is acceptable in terms of verification efficiency, and can reduce the storage cost and communication overhead. As a result, our scheme is suitable for blockchain, which is strict on bandwidth and storage overhead.","@Isaac Villalobos Gutiérrez, it seems that the authore re0-invents anonymous credentials, no?

Given the importance of protecting these secrets to the security and privacy of many software systems, many solutions have been proposed. These solutions take two main directions: either securely store the secret and implement an access control mechanism, or divide the secret into a set of shares and distribute them in different machines (such as the Shamir’s secret sharing approach or multi-party computation MPC). However, apart from the MPC approach, they all share the same limitation: once the consumer receives the secret, it can be leaked and be used by any malicious actor. We believe that the secret management should not be centralised and that the secret should never be sent to the receiver. Therefore, in this paper we propose, Secretation, a new approach for managing the secrets in a decentralised way by leveraging decentralised identity concepts such as verifiable credential technologies, password-authenticated key exchange protocols and multi-party computation. The result is a more scalable and secure solution that significantly reduces the risk of leaking the secrets.",,No,No,,Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka,,"DI, VC",2021,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9461144,,No,,,Not relevant,

Digital Identities and Verifiable Credentials,"Public institutions and companies typically employ physical credentials (such as passports, social security cards, and employee badges) to identify individuals. Individuals can choose where to store their physical credentials, and sometimes, they can decide to whom their credentials are disclosed. These familiar privileges inspired a new type of digital credential called a verifiable credential (VC). Similar to physical credentials, individuals can store their verifiable credentials in a so-called digital wallet on their mobile phone, on another edge device, or in the cloud, and they can use verifiable credentials for identification, authentication, and authorization (Sporny et al. 2019).",,No,Yes,,Ignacio,,"DI, VC",2021,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-021-00722-y,,No,,Albert Garreta,Not relevant,None (not relevant)
Verifiable Credentials in the Token Economy,"This chapter envisions how verifiable credentials could work in the token economy. Many standards-making bodies, open source working groups, organizations, and individuals are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and decentralized verifiable credentials. Commonly suggested principles include identity binding, privacy and security, user control, availability to all, interoperability across platforms, user consent, data minimization, and transparency about data creation, collection, storage, and use. Solutions will likely make use of consensus-driven, international standards in distributed technologies like smart wallets, blockchains, utility tokens, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). To achieve this vision, the roles of issuers, holders, and verifiers—known as the “trust triangle”—must be incentivized to adopt the solution. We provide examples of two early solutions for verifiable credentials: SmartResume and digital health passes (DHPs). iDatafy’s SmartResume is a job market platform that creates digital resumes based on verifiable credentials and secures these credentials on a blockchain. Digital health passes (DHPs) prove our health to verifiers so we can return to travel, work, school, and play. We assess the degree to which these solutions subscribe to the suggested principles of verifiable credentials and describe how participants are incentivized to join the ecosystem. We found that these first-generation solutions meet some, but not yet all, of the suggested principles for fully decentralized verifiable credentials. The early solutions are “minimal viable products” that will likely improve in the future based on feedback and experimentation. Trusted third parties are still needed for services, and interoperability standards, user-generated identifiers, utility tokens are not yet advanced enough for wide-scale adoptions of SSI and verifiable credentials, but we can more easily see the possibilities.",,No,Yes,,Isaac Villalobos Gutiérrez,derivative,VC,2022,Critique,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-95108-5_5,,No,,,Not relevant,
A Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure with Identity Retention,"Public key infrastructures (PKIs) enable users to look up and verify one another's public keys based on identities.
Current approaches to PKIs are vulnerable because they do not offer sufficiently strong guarantees of \emph{identity retention}; that is, they do not effectively prevent one user from registering a public key under another's already-registered identity.
In this paper, we leverage the consistency guarantees provided by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Namecoin to build a PKI that ensures identity retention.

"Dynamic Accumulators and Application to Efficient Revocation of
Anonymous Credentials","An accumulator scheme, as introduced by Benaloh and de Mare [BdM94] and further studied by Baric and Pfitzmann [BP97], is an algorithm that allows one to hash a large set of inputs into one short value, called the accumulator, such that there is a (short) witness that a given input was incorporated into the accumulator. At the same time, it is infeasible to find a witness for a value that was not accumulated. We put forward the notion of a dynamic accumulator, which is an accumulator that allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We achieve this under the strong RSA assumption. For this construction, we also show an efficient zero-knowledge protocol for proving that a committed value is in the accumulator. Dynamic accumulators enable efficient membership revocation in the anonymous setting. Our construction is especially suitable for membership revocation in group signature and identity escrow schemes, such as the one due to Ateniese et al. [ACJT00], and efficient revocation of credentials in anonymous credential systems, such as the one due to Camenisch and Lysyanskaya [CL01a]. Applying our method to these schemes enables membership revocation and yet does not significantly increase the complexity of any of the operations. In particular, the cost of a membership verification or credential
showing increases by only a small constant factor, less than 2. All previously known methods (such as the ones due to Bresson and Stern [BS01] and Ateniese and Tsudik [AT01]) incur an increase in these costs that is linear in the number of members.","@Albert Garreta please provide an abstract

Group signatures with verifier-local revocation,"Group signatures have recently become important for enabling privacy-preserving attestation in projects such as Microsoft's ngscb effort (formerly Palladium). Revocation is critical to the security of such systems. We construct a short group signature scheme that supports Verifier-Local Revocation (VLR). In this model, revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers (as opposed to both signers and verifiers). Consequently there is no need to contact individual signers when some user is revoked. This model is appealing for systems providing attestation capabilities. Our signatures are as short as standard RSA signatures with comparable security. Security of our group signature (in the random oracle model) is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear assumption in bilinear groups. We give a precise model for VLR group signatures and discuss its implications.",@Ahmet Ramazan Agirtas please provide an abstract,No,No,,Ahmet Ramazan Agirtas,,,2004,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1030083.1030106,,No,,,Maybe relevant,Academic literature
Anonymous credentials light,"We define and propose an efficient and provably secure construction of blind signatures with attributes. Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards.

Minimal information disclosure with efficiently verifiable credentials,"Public-key based certificates provide a standard way to prove one's identity, as attested by some certificate authority (CA). However, plain certificates provide a binary identification: either the whole identity of the subject is known, or nothing is known. We propose using a Merkle hash tree structure, whereby it is possible for a single certificate to contain many separate claims or attributes, each of which may be proved independently, without revealing the others. Additionally, we demonstrate how trees from multiple sources can be combined together by modifying the tree structure. This allows claims by different authorities, such as an employer or professional organization, to be combined under a single certificate, without the CA needing to know (or to verify) all of the claims. In addition to describing the hash tree structure and protocols for constructing and verifying our proposed credential, we formally prove that it provides unforgeability and privacy and we present performance results demonstrating its efficiency. As services move from user names and passwords to attribute-based identity verification, efficiency and scalability of claims verification will become a major issue. We have implemented a prototype client-server system, deployed the prototype in Emulab, and evaluated the server-side throughput for attribute-based identity verification. The results show that our approach can perform about 200 identity verifications per second, while the best competing approach can perform only about 2--5 verifications per second.

Infrastructure","Frequently, users on the web need to show that they are, for example, not a robot, old enough to access an age restricted video, or eligible to download an ebook from their local public library without being tracked.

Instead, they make (often incorrect) assumptions, e.g., that the local department of motor vehicles will issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols. We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued via a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials.

The use of cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization.

I am planning to propose revisiting the and similar projects: they rely on permissioned “validators”, but still, we have been working precisely on how to remove the “permission” part in this type of projects, so maybe we can use a solution based on them.

A Survey on Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials,"There are at least two principal approaches to prevent users from sharing their anonymous credentials: adding valuable secrets into the system the user does not want to share or embedding biometric access control. This paper seeks to identify possible fields of application and to compare both approaches with respect to the credentials’ non-transferability.
The paper shows that both approaches do not ensure the non- transferability of anonymous credentials, but may be applicable in some fields. On the one hand, it might be hard to find valuable secrets to really prevent the sharing of credentials, in particular with close family members. On the other hand, biometric sensors embedded in a smartcard can be circumvented with some effort, especially if access control is unattended. Although the combination of both approaches may prevent more users from sharing their credentials, it suffers from restrictions of both approaches and from the effort needed to put it in place.
However, assuming that anonymous credentials will probably not be used in high-security environments, both approaches might be sufficient to prevent sharing in some applications. If the users already possess personal digital assistants, embedded valuable secrets are a quite cheap solution, even though they raise the system’s value. If access control is attended, biometric sensors are reasonably safe and limit the possibility of unintentionally sharing the credentials for free.","@Albert Garreta any thoughts about this paper?

The second vein in the literature considers defending against the attack by testing resources, which can
be in the form of IP testing, network coordinates, or recurring cost (e.g., by requiring clients to solve puzzles). The third and last vein in the literature is by mitigating the attack, combining social

NSSIA: A New Self-Sovereign Identity Scheme with Accountability,"Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new distributed method for identity management, commonly used to address the problem that users are lack of control over their identities. However, the excessive pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers. To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but they sacrifice users’ privacy. In addition, the digital identities (static strings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, and users’ self-sovereignty are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program. In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition, a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users’ privacy. Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in terms of the cost of computation, storage, and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain storage, and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations.",,No,No,,Aycan,,,2022,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/1607996/,,No,,,,
Privacy-preserving Identity Management System,"Abstract. Recently, a self-sovereign identity model has been researched actively as an alternative to the existing identity models such as a centralized identity model, federated identity model, and user-centric model.  The self-sovereign identity model allows a user to have complete control of his identity. Meanwhile, the core component of the self-sovereign identity model is data minimization. The data minimization signifies that the extent of the exposure of user private identity should be minimized. As a solution to data minimization, zero-knowledge proofs can be grafted to the self-sovereign identity model. Specifically, zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledges(zk-SNARKs) enables proving the truth of the statement on an arbitrary relation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving self-sovereign identity model based on zkSNARKs to allow any type of data minimization beyond the selective disclosure and range proof. The security of proposed model is formally proven under the security of the zero-knowledge proof and the unforgeability of the signature in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we optimize the proving time by checking the correctness of the commitment outside of the proof relation for practical use. The resulting scheme improves proving time for hash computation (to verify a commitment input) from 0.5 s to about 0.1 ms on a 32-bit input.",,No,Yes,,Genya,,Anonymous Credentials,2021,,https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1459.pdf,,No,,,Maybe relevant,Academic literature
Computational Puzzles as Sybil Defenses,"We consider the problem of defending against Sybil
attacks using computational puzzles. A fundamental difﬁculty in
such defenses is enforcing that puzzle solutions not be reused by
attackers over time. We propose a fully decentralized scheme
to enforce this by continually distributing locally generated
challenges that are then incorporated into the puzzle solutions.
Our approach consists of an all-to-all broadcast of challenges,
with a combining function to ensure this can be done efﬁciently.
The combining function generates certiﬁcates that can be used
to prove that each node’s challenge was delivered to and used by

"Permissionless Blockchain-Based
Sybil-Resistant Self-Sovereign Identity Utilizing Attested Execution Secure Processors","The current circumstance that requires people more
online has encouraged us to address digital identity preserving
privacy. There is a momentum of research addressing Self-
Sovereign Identity (SSI); many research approach blockchain
technology as a foundation. SSI brings natural persons various
benefits such as their owning controls; on the other side, digital
identity systems in the real world require Sybil-resistance to
comply with Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and other needs.
Our proposal in this paper is to build a secure SSI system
by utilizing permissionless blockchain and Rafael Pass et al.’s
contribution of the formal abstraction of Attested Execution
Secure Processors (AESPs). Our proposal of the AESP-based
SSI architecture and system protocols, $\Pi^{G_{}att}$ , demonstrates the
powerfulness of hardware-assisted security and the formal abstraction
of AESPs, fitting into building a proper SSI system that
satisfies Sybil-resistance. Assuming AESPs and $G_{att}$, the protocols
may eliminate the online distributed committee assumed in other
research such as CanDID; thus, $\Pi^{G_{}att}$ allows not to rely on multiparty
computation (MPC), and it brings drastic flexibility and

Sybil-Resistant, Anonymous Authentication on
Permissionless Blockchains and Incentive Compatible,
Strictly Dominant Cryptocurrencies@","Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity from trusted public certificates (e.g.,
national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to
permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-
resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and en-
vironmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower
transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number
of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping
membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full de-
centralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated
on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic
random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.
Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI
cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:
- an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency
rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium
- strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies,
thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners
is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
- PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-
Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements
the social optimum
- the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other
PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
- the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to na-
tional identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies

A Truth-Inducing Sybil Resistant Decentralized Blockchain Oracle,"Many blockchain applications use decentralized oracles to trustlessly retrieve external information as those platforms are agnostic to real-world information. Some existing decentralized oracle protocols make use of majority-voting schemes to determine the outcomes and/or rewards to participants. In these cases, the awards (or penalties) grow linearly to the participant stakes, therefore voters are indifferent between voting through a single or multiple identities. Furthermore, the voters receive a reward only when they agree with the majority outcome, a tactic that may lead to herd behavior. This paper proposes an oracle protocol based on peer prediction mechanisms with non-linear staking rules. In the proposed approach, instead of being rewarded when agreeing with a majority outcome, a voter receives awards when their report achieves a relatively high score based on a peer prediction scoring scheme. The scoring scheme is designed to be incentive compatible so that the maximized expected score is achieved only with honest reporting. A non-linear stake scaling rule is proposed to discourage Sybil attacks. This paper also provides a theoretical analysis and guidelines for implementation as reference.",We need to describe it in the SoK,No,Yes,,Genya,derivative,Oracles,2020,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9223272,,No,"November 15, 2022",Albert Garreta,Very relevant,Sybil resilience
Who Watches the Watchmen? A Review of Subjective Approaches for Sybil-Resistance in Proof of Personhood Protocols,"Most self-sovereign identity systems consist of strictly objective claims, cryptographically signed by trusted third-party attestors. Lacking protocols in place to account for subjectivity, these systems do not form new sources of legitimacy that can address the central question concerning identity authentication: “Who verifies the verifier?” The legitimacy of claims is instead derived from traditional centralized institutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers. This architecture has been employed, in part, to safeguard protocols from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in peer-to-peer identity systems: the Sybil attack, which refers to the abuse of a digital network by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting to arrive at a decentralized and Sybil-resistant consensus for identity. In doing so, these projects illustrate that the best technologies do not abstract away subjectivity but instead embrace it as a necessity and strength. In this review, we will outline the approaches of these new and natively digital sources of authentication—their attributes, methodologies, strengths, and weaknesses—and sketch out possible directions for future developments.",@Jorge Arce-Garro it may provide some discussion on Sybil resistance,No,No,,Isaac Villalobos Gutiérrez,,,2020,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.590171/full,,No,"November 23, 2022",Jorge Arce-Garro,Relevant,
SYBILFUSE: Combining Local Attributes with Global Structure to Perform Robust Sybil Detection,"Sybil attacks are becoming increasingly widespread and pose a significant threat to online social systems; a single adversary can inject multiple colluding identities in the system to compromise security and privacy. Recent works have leveraged social network-based trust relationships to defend against Sybil attacks. However, existing defenses are based on oversimplified assumptions about network structure, which do not necessarily hold in real-world social networks. Recognizing these limitations, we propose SYBILFUSE, a defense-in-depth framework for Sybil detection when the oversimplified assumptions are relaxed. SYBILFUSE adopts a collective classification approach by first training local classifiers to compute local trust scores for nodes and edges, and then propagating the local scores through the global network structure via weighted random walk and loopy belief propagation mechanisms. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, including a large-scale, labeled Twitter network comprising 20M nodes and 265M edges, and demonstrate that SYBILFUSE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. In particular, SYBILFUSE achieves 98% of Sybil coverage among top-ranked nodes.","@Jorge Arce-Garro That seems very relevant to the further part of the project, WDYT?",No,No,,Basireddy Swaroopa Reddy,,,2018,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8433147,,No,"November 21, 2022",,,Sybil resilience
Decentralized Update Selection with Semi-strategic Experts,"Motivated by governance models adopted in blockchain applications, we study the problem of selecting appropriate system updates in a decentralized way. Contrary to most existing voting approaches, we use the input of a set of motivated experts of varying levels of expertise. In particular, we develop an approval voting inspired selection mechanism through which the experts approve or disapprove the different updates according to their perception of the quality of each alternative. Given their opinions, and weighted by their expertise level, a single update is then implemented and evaluated, and the experts receive rewards based on their choices. We show that this mechanism always has approximate pure Nash equilibria and that these achieve a constant factor approximation with respect to the quality benchmark of the optimal alternative. Finally, we study the repeated version of the problem, where the weights of the experts are adjusted after each update, according to their performance. Under mild assumptions about the weights, the extension of our mechanism still has approximate pure Nash equilibria in this setting.",@Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka could you provide an abstract of thisd paper? @Michal Zajac Done,No,No,,Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka,,,September 2022,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15714-1_23,,No,,,Maybe relevant,Hybrid

Privacy for Personal Data","In the digital revolution, even secure
communication between individuals, services and devices
through centralized digital entities presents considerable risks.
Service providers collect and store information that is used
for data mining, profiling and exploitation without users'
knowledge or consent. Having service providers continue to
offer their centric solutions is inefficient in terms of
duplication, has serious security lacunae and is cumbersome
to the users. The Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, which
includes the individual's consolidated digital identity and

ownership and gain insights from their data’s usage. The
authentication and verification of digital identity is essential
to achieve the privacy and security of distributed digital
identities. However, the current literature still lacks the
comprehensive study on components of identity management
as well as user privacy and data protection mechanisms in
identity management architecture. In this paper, we provide a
coherent view of the central concepts of SSI, including the
components of identity proofing and authentication solutions
for different SSI solutions. Firstly, we discussed an overview
of Identity management approaches, introducing an
architecture overview as well as the relevant actors in such a
system and blockchain technology as solution for distributed

ZEBRA: Anonymous Credentials with Practical On-chain Verification and Applications to KYC in DeFi,"ZEBRA is an Anonymous Credential (AC) scheme, supporting auditability and revocation, that provides practical on-chain verification for the first time. It realizes efficient access control on permissionless blockchains while achieving both privacy and accountability. In all prior solutions, users either pay exorbitant fees or lose privacy since authorities granting access can map users to their wallets. Hence, ZEBRA is the first to enable DeFi platforms to remain compliant with imminent regulations without compromising user privacy.
We evaluate ZEBRA and show that it reduces the gas cost incurred on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by 11.8x when compared to Coconut [NDSS 2019], the state-of-the-art AC scheme for blockchains. This translates to a reduction in transaction fees from 94 USD to 8 USD on Ethereum in August 2022. However, 8 USD is still high for most applications, and ZEBRA further drives down credential verification costs through batched verification. For a batch of 512 layer-1 and layer-2 wallets, the gas cost is reduced by 35x and 641x on EVM, and the transaction fee is reduced to just 0.23 USD and 0.0126 USD on Ethereum, respectively.
